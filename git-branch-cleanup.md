# Generic Git Branch Cleanup Procedure

Abstract framework for **cleaning up** a `topic` branch: producing a *new* branch with a
clean, legible commit history whose **final state is byte-for-byte identical** to `topic`
(modulo explained baseline updates). The branch does not move — `base` stays fixed, there is no
upstream to absorb. The only thing that changes is the *shape of the history*: commits are
reordered, split, merged, and newly authored so that a reviewer can read the branch and
immediately tell **what is a refactor, what is a bug fix, and what is a new feature**, validate
each in isolation, and trust that nothing was smuggled in.

Cleanup recomposes the total diff freely — down to the hunk, and even sub-hunk, level — so
commits can be split, merged, reordered, and newly authored at will. The price of that freedom is
a central invariant, the **coverage ledger**, which proves the recomposition lost and invented
nothing.

The framework is domain-agnostic at the workflow level but assumes **opp_repl** as the test
infrastructure (fingerprint, statistical, chart tests; baselines in `fingerprint.json` /
`.sca` files; dependency store in `dependency.json`). State is kept in a separate markdown
file so the procedure can be resumed from disk alone if the AI conversation is lost.

## How it operates (at a glance)

1. Compute the **total diff** `base..topic` and read every commit. Semantically decompose the
   total diff into **new features / refactors / bug fixes / chores** (Phase 0 analysis file).
2. Partition the total diff into ordered **change groups** — independently-applicable slices of
   the diff, each with a single type and intent (human-approved). Groups may be merged or
   subdivided later as understanding improves.
3. Decide the **output-commit plan**: the linear sequence of clean commits the new branch will
   contain, their types, messages, order, and each one's **expected test effect** (fingerprint
   identical for refactors; fingerprint changed + baseline updated for fixes/features).
4. Build the clean branch **forward**, one commit at a time, off `base`. After each commit,
   build + run the **scoped opp_repl test** and update the **coverage ledger**
   (`remaining = git diff cleanHEAD topic`). The ledger drives to empty — monotonically, save for
   tracked **temporary detours** (scaffolding added now and removed later, net zero).
5. The test is the **oracle for the commit's claimed type**:
   - a commit labelled *refactor* MUST leave the fingerprint **IDENTICAL** to the previous
     commit — if it doesn't, the label is wrong or behavior leaked in; STOP and investigate;
   - a commit labelled *fix*/*feature* MAY change the fingerprint, but only in an **explained**
     way, with the **baseline updated inside that same commit** so it stays green.
6. Every validated commit is a **safe point**. Progress (plan, ledger, per-commit log with
   `what changed / why the result changed / why it's acceptable / baseline update` entries for
   every behavior change) lives in a single markdown logbook so cleanup is resumable from disk
   alone if the AI conversation is lost.
7. When the ledger reaches **empty**, finalize: prove tree-equality against `topic`, run the
   **full (unscoped)** test suite, and confirm the clean branch is green end to end.

## Inputs

The instance must supply, before any cleanup work starts:

- **`topic`** — branch to clean up (its final tree is the pinned target / oracle).
- **`base`** — branch or commit identifying the starting point (`base..topic` = the material to
  recompose). The clean branch is built starting from this exact commit; it never moves.
- **tests** — which opp_repl test types to run as the per-commit regression test, in priority
  order, plus any scope hints. **Defaults**: `[fingerprint, statistical]`, **run number 0 only**
  (other runs ignored unless the instance opts in). The same suite, run **unscoped**, is the
  Phase 6 acceptance test.

These inputs are recorded verbatim in the state file header.

## Conventions

- `base` — fixed starting commit; the clean branch is built on top of it.
- `topic` — branch being cleaned; **never modified**. Its final tree is the target/oracle.
- `clean` — the new branch under construction (`cleanup/<name>`): the legible history whose
  final tree must equal `topic`'s.
- **output commit** — one commit on `clean`. Each has a declared **type**
  (`refactor` | `fix` | `feature` | `chore`/`docs`/`baseline`) and a single clear intent.
- **change group** — an independently-applicable slice of the total diff (a set of files, hunks,
  or hand-authored edits) that feeds one or more output commits. The atomic unit is the hunk **by
  default, but not the floor**: a hunk that mixes types (a refactor and a feature in adjacent
  lines) is split **sub-hunk**, down to individual lines or characters where necessary. Splitting,
  merging, and reordering are the whole point.
- **temporary detour** — content deliberately added in one commit and removed in a later one
  (`+delta … −delta`), netting to **zero** across the branch. A detour is scaffolding present in
  neither `base` nor `topic`; it exists only to keep intermediate commits building/passing when
  reordering alone can't (a shim, a stub, a forward declaration, a retained old code path). It is
  *not* part of the total diff, so it must be tracked and must close before finalization.
- **coverage ledger** — the live accounting that every part of the total diff is assigned to
  exactly one output commit and nothing is *permanently* invented. Operationally: `remaining =
  git diff cleanHEAD topic`. Starts equal to the total diff and ends empty. It shrinks
  monotonically **except across an open detour**: adding a detour's scaffold makes `remaining`
  temporarily *grow* (the scaffold is something `topic` lacks, so the diff now carries its
  eventual removal), and closing the detour shrinks it back. A tracked detour is the only
  legitimate reason for the ledger to move *away* from empty.

## Core invariant & acceptance criterion

Cleanup is **correct** iff, at the end:

1. **Source tree identical** — `git diff topic clean` is empty over all non-baseline files. This
   is the hard, mechanical guarantee that the recomposition neither lost nor invented any code.
   It is *checkable at every step* as the coverage ledger's `remaining` diff.
2. **Baselines correct & explained** — baseline/test-artifact files (`fingerprint.json`,
   `*.sca`, `dependency.json`) on `clean` either match `topic` exactly **or** differ only by
   being *correctly updated to reflect the branch's actual behavior*, with every such difference
   explained in the state file. In the ideal case where `topic` already maintained its
   baselines, there is **no difference at all** and criterion 1 covers everything.
3. **Every commit green (relaxed)** — every output commit **builds** and **passes** the scoped
   test. Relaxation is permitted for individual commits that are genuinely too difficult to make
   green in isolation (e.g. a mid-series refactor that only type-checks once the next commit
   lands), but only with an explicit, logged justification. Prefer to **never break the build**;
   a red *test* with a logged reason is tolerable, a red *build* almost never is.

Why the baseline carve-out is honest: the source tree fully determines simulation behavior, so
identical source ⇒ identical behavior. Baseline files are *test artifacts describing* that
behavior. If `topic` left them stale (tests red on `topic`), `clean` will additionally correct
them — a legitimate, explained divergence in the test-artifact files only, never in source.

## Phase 0 — Analysis

Before partitioning, understand the whole change:

- `git log --stat` and `git diff --stat` for `base..topic`; read the full `base..topic` diff.
- Categorize **the total diff**, not just the commits: which portions are new features, which
  are behavior-preserving refactors (renames/moves/extractions/formatting), which are bug fixes,
  which are chores. The same source commit often mixes all four — that mixing is exactly what
  cleanup untangles, so categorize at the **hunk** level.
- Map each category to files/areas and approximate hunk locations. Note **dependencies** between
  changes (a feature that builds on a refactor; a fix to code a refactor moves).
- opp_repl dependency-store queries (`dependency.json`): changed files → NED packages → features
  → simulation configs, to scope per-commit tests and predict which configs each group affects.
- Record the **base/topic HEAD SHAs** and the **total-diff size** (files, +/- lines) as the
  ledger's starting magnitude.

Output: a **separate analysis file** at `ai-logs/executions/<date>_<cleanup-name>.analysis.md`
containing the SHAs, the hunk-level categorization, the dependency map, the dep-store findings,
and a first-cut grouping proposal. The analysis file is the durable Phase 0 artefact; the state
file references it rather than duplicating it.

## Phase 1 — Decomposition into change groups

Partition the total diff into an ordered list of change groups `G1, G2, …, Gn`.

- **Atomic unit**: the hunk **by default, but not the floor** — a hunk that mixes types is split
  sub-hunk, down to single lines or characters where a refactor and a feature share a line.
- **Single type per group**: each group is wholly a refactor, a fix, a feature, or a chore. If a
  region of the diff resists a single label, split it until each piece has one.
- **Independence**: prefer groups that can be applied in isolation. Where the diff has dependent
  changes in the same region (a refactor later modified by a feature), the group boundary may
  require **hand-authored intermediate states** — file contents matching neither `base` nor
  `topic` — staged as separate commits. Where no clean order keeps every commit green, a
  **temporary detour** (scaffold added now, removed by a later commit; net zero) is the escape
  hatch. Either way the coverage ledger keeps it honest: whatever intermediate states or detours
  are authored, the *final* tree must still equal `topic` and every detour must close.
- **Total coverage**: every hunk of the total diff belongs to exactly one group. Nothing is
  dropped (there is nothing to drop — the final tree is pinned); nothing is duplicated.
- **Authority**: AI proposes the grouping; **human approves** before build work starts.
- **Mid-flight regrouping**: groups may be split or merged as understanding improves. When that
  happens, new groups take fresh IDs (`G{n+1}, …`; IDs only grow), and the state file records
  `superseded-by` relationships. There are no per-group git branches to fossilize; the fossil
  record is the state file's group table plus the `clean` branch's own history.

Goal of grouping: **minimize the reasoning surface per commit** so a reviewer can validate each
output commit on its own and attribute any surprise to a single, well-labelled change.

## Phase 2 — Output-commit plan & ordering

Map groups onto the linear sequence of output commits the `clean` branch will contain. A group
may become one commit, several commits, or be merged with others into one — the mapping is the
AI's proposal, human-approved.

**Default ordering** (override per instance with logged rationale):

1. **Behavior-preserving first** — refactors, renames, moves, extractions, formatting, comment
   changes. These keep the fingerprint **identical** and form a stable base the rest builds on.
   Putting them first lets a reviewer clear them quickly (the test *proves* they're inert) and
   concentrate attention on the smaller, meaningful commits.
2. **Bug fixes next** — each isolated, each with a description of the bug and its symptom.
   Fingerprint changes here are the fix's intended effect: explained and baselined in-commit.
3. **New features last** — each feature a cohesive commit or short series, built on
   already-refactored code. Fingerprint additions explained and baselined in-commit.
4. **Baseline-only commits** — avoid them; prefer folding each baseline update into the commit
   that causes the behavior change (so every commit is independently green and the
   `fingerprint.json`/`.sca` delta is part of that change's reviewable story). A standalone
   baseline commit is a last resort, logged.

When changes are genuinely independent across subsystems, a **per-subsystem cluster**
(refactor→fix→feature within one subsystem, then the next) can read more clearly than a global
refactor-then-fix-then-feature sweep. Use judgment; when the clearer ordering is ambiguous, ASK.

Record the plan in the state file: the ordered commit list, each with type, message subject,
feeding group(s), and **expected test effect** (`fingerprint IDENTICAL` vs `fingerprint CHANGES
— baseline update expected on configs X, Y`).

## Phase 3 — Test contract

One test invocation per output commit, via opp_repl, with build folded in.

- **Build folded into the test step**: a build failure surfaces as a test ERROR (distinct from a
  FAIL, same loop).
- **Scope**: run only the configs the dep store (`dependency.json`) flags as affected by the
  commit's changes; within each config, **run number 0** only (unless the instance opted in).
- **The test is the type oracle** — this is the cleanup-specific use of testing:
  - **refactor / chore commit** → fingerprint **must be IDENTICAL** to the previous commit on
    every affected config. A mismatch means the change is not actually behavior-preserving:
    either a real behavior change leaked in (mislabelled — re-classify and re-plan) or there's
    an accidental bug (fix it). **STOP and investigate; do not paper over with a baseline update.**
  - **fix / feature commit** → fingerprint **may change**. The change must be (a) intended and
    explained, (b) confined to the configs the dep store predicted, and (c) reconciled by
    **updating the baseline inside the same commit**.
- **Baseline updates** (opp_repl mechanics):
  - Fingerprint: re-record via `update_fingerprint_test_results(...)` (→
    `FingerprintStore.update_fingerprint`, writing `fingerprint.json`; result codes
    `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`KEEP`). Stage the resulting `fingerprint.json` delta into the commit.
  - Statistical: re-record via `update_statistical_test_results(...)` (copies the current `.sca`
    into the baseline dir). Stage the `.sca` delta into the commit.
  - The baseline delta becoming part of the commit is a feature, not a nuisance: it makes the
    behavior change auditable and keeps every commit green.
- **Result handling**: results are **ephemeral** — consumed to write the state file's prose, then
  discarded. The state file is the durable record of what happened.

Diagnosis baselines available when a commit misbehaves:
- `results_topic` (the intended final behavior),
- `results_base` (the starting reference),
- `results_clean@prev` (the previous output commit — the immediate control for "did *this* commit
  change behavior?").

## Phase 4 — The build loop

Build `clean` forward from `base`, one output commit at a time. For each planned commit `Ck`:

1. **Author the commit's content.** Pick the cheapest mechanism that produces exactly the group's
   slice:
   - *file-disjoint group* → `git checkout topic -- <files>` to pull the final version of files
     this group wholly owns, then commit;
   - *sub-file group* → apply a curated subset of hunks (`git apply` of a hand-trimmed patch, or
     interactive `git checkout -p` / `git add -p` against `topic`), then commit;
   - *dependent region* → hand-author the intermediate file state, then commit;
   - *can't stay green by ordering alone* → open a **temporary detour**: add a scaffold (record it
     as an open detour), commit, and schedule the matching removal commit later in the plan.
2. **Build + run the scoped test** (Phase 3).
3. **Check the type oracle**: refactor ⇒ expect fingerprint IDENTICAL; fix/feature ⇒ expect the
   predicted change. On a surprise, STOP (do not advance the ledger).
4. **Reconcile baselines** for fix/feature commits (update `fingerprint.json` / `.sca`, `git add`
   them, `--amend` into `Ck` so the commit is self-consistently green).
5. **Update the coverage ledger**: recompute `remaining = git diff cleanHEAD topic`. Confirm it
   moved by exactly this commit's intended effect — *shrank* by the group's slice for an ordinary
   commit, *grew* by the scaffold for a detour-opening commit, *shrank back* for a detour-closing
   commit — and that no *unintended* file changed. Record any newly-opened or now-closed detour.
   The ledger plus the open-detour list is the live, resumable-cold progress signal — another
   agent can reconstruct "what's left" from this diff, the open detours, and the plan.
6. **PASS** → the commit is a **safe point**; append a progress-log entry; continue silently.
7. **FAIL / ERROR / oracle-surprise** →
   - Diagnose against the Phase 3 baselines; write narrative root-cause prose.
   - **Build/test red because of ordering** (a commit references something a later group
     introduces) → reorder the plan, merge the two groups, or — when neither is clean — open a
     **temporary detour** (a bridging scaffold removed by a later commit, net zero). Log the
     regrouping or the detour (IDs only grow; detours stay tracked until closed).
   - **Refactor changed the fingerprint** → re-classify (it was secretly a fix/feature) or fix the
     accidental bug. Re-plan the affected commits. **ASK** the human with the finding.
   - **Genuinely too hard to make this single commit green** → first try reordering or a temporary
     detour to keep it green; only if both are worse than the disease, fall back to the relaxed
     rule: log the explicit justification, keep the build green if at all possible, and carry the
     test expectation forward to the commit that resolves it.
   - On any non-trivial ambiguity, **STOP and ASK**.

Rework discipline: prefer append-only forward progress; each validated commit is a safe point. If
re-partitioning forces rewriting an already-built commit, snapshot the current tip as a fossil
(`cleanup/<name>/checkpoint-<ISO8601>`) **before** any reset/`rebase -i`, then rebuild forward.
`topic` is never touched; it remains the oracle throughout.

## Phase 5 — Human ASK seams

Runs autonomously on the happy path; pauses for human input at:

- Initial grouping proposal (Phase 1) and initial output-commit plan / ordering (Phase 2).
- Any commit where a *refactor* changed the fingerprint (mislabel vs. accidental bug).
- Any behavior change whose acceptability is not obvious (is this fingerprint delta *intended*?).
- Group split/merge or output-commit reordering that changes the approved plan.
- A commit that must be left test-red under the relaxed rule.
- Any decision that is difficult or ambiguous to make.
- Final delivery (Phase 6).

No ASK on a clean PASS that matches the planned expectation.

## Phase 6 — Finalization

When the coverage ledger reaches **empty**:

1. **Prove tree-equality**: `git diff topic clean` is empty over non-baseline files **and the
   open-detours list is empty**. Any residual delta is a partition bug or an unclosed detour (its
   scaffold lives on `clean` but not `topic`) — resolve it before declaring done. List any
   baseline-file differences from `topic` with their per-commit explanations (ideally none).
2. **Full (unscoped) test**: run the full opp_repl suite (all flagged configs; run 0, or wider if
   the instance opted in) on `clean`. Confirm green end to end. Spot-check a few commits in the
   middle of the history to confirm they too build and pass (the per-commit safe points should
   already guarantee this; verify a sample).
3. **Confirm the story reads**: the commit list, top to bottom, separates refactors from fixes
   from features, each message states intent, and each behavior change carries its baseline delta.
4. Write the **Finalization** section: the final ordered commit list with types, the
   tree-equality proof, the full-suite result, and the mapping of every behavior-changing commit
   to its `why-changed / why-acceptable / baseline-update` explanation.

## Branches & safe points

- `cleanup/<name>` — the `clean` branch under construction. Advances one validated commit at a
  time; every validated commit is a safe point.
- `cleanup/<name>/checkpoint-<ISO8601>` — fossil snapshot taken before any rework that would
  rewrite already-built commits. Preserved, never deleted.
- `topic` — never modified; the oracle. `base` — never modified; the start point.
- **Branches only, no tags.** Branch names are the authoritative reference to safe points. IDs
  (group IDs, checkpoint timestamps) only grow; nothing is renamed or deleted.

## State file

- **Location**: `ai-logs/executions/<date>_<cleanup-name>.md` (one file per cleanup; separate
  from `ai-logs/plans/`).
- **Format**: single markdown file, curated head sections + append-only progress log.
- **Resumable cold**: must contain enough — together with the `clean` branch and `git diff
  cleanHEAD topic` — to continue even if the AI conversation is lost.
- **Timestamps**: every date/time inside the file is full ISO 8601 with seconds
  (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`); the filename keeps the date-only form for legibility.

Required sections:

1. **Header** — SHAs of `base` and `topic`; instance/project info; opp_repl test invocation
   (types, run 0, scope rule); baseline-store paths (`fingerprint.json`, `.sca` dir,
   `dependency.json`); the `clean` branch name; link to the Phase 0 analysis file.
2. **Total-diff analysis** — the Phase 0 hunk-level categorization (features / refactors / fixes /
   chores) mapped to files/areas, with the dependency map between changes and the dep-store
   config impact. Summarized here; full detail in the analysis file.
3. **Change groups** (Phase 1) — table: id, type, intent, source material (files + hunk refs),
   independence/dependency notes, target output commit(s). Superseded groups remain with
   `superseded-by` annotation.
4. **Output-commit plan** (Phase 2) — the ordered commit list: position, type, message subject,
   feeding group(s), and **expected test effect** (`fingerprint IDENTICAL` vs `CHANGES on X,Y +
   baseline update`). Edited in place as the plan evolves.
5. **Coverage ledger** — the live "what's left" view: total-diff magnitude (files, +/- lines);
   applied-so-far; `remaining = git diff cleanHEAD topic` magnitude; a per-file checklist marking
   each as fully-assigned / partially-assigned / untouched; and an **open-detours** list — every
   temporary scaffold added but not yet removed, with the commit that opened it and the planned
   commit that will close it. The single source of truth for progress; refreshed after every
   commit. Completion requires `remaining` empty **and** zero open detours.
6. **Progress & safe points** — the `clean` branch's validated commits (SHA, subject, type, test
   status), the latest safe point, and a % complete (e.g. `1 − remaining/total` by line volume).
7. **Progress log** (append-only) — one entry per output commit built (or per rework attempt):
   - timestamp (full ISO 8601), output commit position + planned type, the commit SHA + subject.
   - diff material absorbed (which groups/hunks), and the post-commit ledger delta.
   - build result; scoped test result (PASS / FAIL / ERROR); affected configs.
   - **for a refactor/chore commit**: one line confirming the oracle —
     `fingerprint IDENTICAL vs prev on configs {…} — behavior-preserving confirmed`.
   - **for a fix/feature commit (behavior change)**: a sub-entry with these four labelled fields,
     in this order:
     - **What changed**: the code change and the test delta it produced — exact configs and the
       nature of the fingerprint/statistical change (e.g. `fingerprint hash changed on config X
       run 0`; `+954 statistical rows, additive only, 0 conflicting values`). Avoid vague phrasing.
     - **Why the result changed**: the causal mechanism — what in the code makes the simulation
       behave differently, tied to the specific lines this commit introduces.
     - **Why it's acceptable**: why this new behavior is correct/intended (it's the bug fix's
       point; it's the new feature's output), and why nothing *else* should have moved (the change
       is confined to the dep-store-predicted configs; unrelated configs stayed IDENTICAL).
     - **Baseline update**: which baseline entries were re-recorded and how
       (`update_fingerprint_test_results` → `fingerprint.json` entries for X,Y, codes UPDATE/INSERT;
       or `update_statistical_test_results` → `.sca` files copied), and confirmation they are
       staged into this same commit.
   - **for a detour-opening / detour-closing commit**: the detour id, the scaffold added or
     removed, why ordering couldn't avoid it, and the ledger's expected transient growth/shrink.
     An open detour stays listed in §5 until its closing commit lands.
   - **for a relaxed (left-red) commit**: the explicit justification and which later commit is
     expected to turn it green.
8. **Open issues / next step** — pending ambiguities, pending ASKs, planned next commit.
9. **Finalization** (Phase 6) — final ordered commit list with types; confirmation that **zero
   temporary detours remain open**; the `git diff topic clean` tree-equality proof (and any
   explained baseline-file differences); the full-suite test result; the complete behavior-change
   → explanation → baseline-update mapping.

Treat the file as a logbook: only the head sections (1–6, 8) are edited in place; the progress
log (7) is append-only; Finalization (9) is written once at the end.
