## Select the capture point

Inspect the instantiated NED model and effective INI configuration before adding a recorder. Determine:

* The node path and whether it exposes `numPcapRecorders`.
* The interface or protocol layer whose packet signal answers the question.
* Whether sender, receiver, AP/router, or several observation points are required.

`moduleNamePatterns` is relative to the node containing the recorder. Use `eth[0]`, `wlan[0]`, or `ppp[0]`, not a full network path. A custom node may not inherit recorder support; inspect its NED ancestry instead of forcing an override.

Ingress/egress meaning depends on the packet signal observed at that module. Inspect the recorder subscription or module source when direction is not explicit in the capture.

## Add a recorder with command-line overrides

Store the known-good command from `inet-simulation-run` in a Bash array named `INET_RUN`, then append narrow recorder overrides:

```sh
NODE='*.host[0]'
PCAP="logs/${CONFIG}-${RUN}-host0-eth0.pcapng"

"${INET_RUN[@]}" \
  -c "$CONFIG" \
  -r "$RUN" \
  "--${NODE}.numPcapRecorders=1" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].pcapFile=\"$PCAP\"" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].fileFormat=\"pcapng\"" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].timePrecision=9" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].moduleNamePatterns=\"eth[0]\"" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].alwaysFlush=true" \
  "--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].verbose=false" \
  '--**.checksumMode="computed"' \
  '--**.fcsMode="computed"'
```

Use unique filenames that identify configuration, run, node, interface, and recorder. `alwaysFlush=true` is useful for diagnostic runs that may abort; disable it for long performance-sensitive runs only when losing the last buffered packets is acceptable.

Use several recorders and separate files when capture points must remain distinguishable.

Always include the two global computed-mode overrides on the first diagnostic capture run unless the effective configuration already sets both. They make packet serialization capture-ready and avoid rerunning a simulation after the recorder encounters declared or unavailable checksum/FCS data. The INI values are the string `"computed"`; `CHECKSUM_COMPUTED` and `FCS_COMPUTED` are C++ enum names, not command-line values.

## Select the recorded representation

`moduleNamePatterns` selects where packets are observed. `dumpProtocols` selects which protocol representation is written. For example:

```sh
"--${NODE}.pcapRecorder[0].dumpProtocols=\"ipv4 ipv6\""
```

For native Wi-Fi analysis, select the installed model's IEEE 802.11 MAC representation. If INET cannot determine or convert the link type, inspect the capture module, `dumpProtocols`, packet protocol tags, and available recorder helpers.

Record the computed checksum and FCS overrides with the run command because they may change model behavior. If the investigation depends on the difference between declared and computed modes, preserve an unmodified baseline run for comparison, but keep the capture run serialization-ready from its first attempt.

## Bound capture cost

Prefer narrowing the observation point or time interval. When needed:

* Set `snaplen` only if truncation will not remove required headers or payload.
* Use an INET `packetFilter` expression to reduce recording at the source.
* Do not use Wireshark display-filter syntax in `packetFilter`.
* Record broadly and filter afterward when the correct INET expression is uncertain.

## Validate the artifact

Before reasoning from the capture, confirm that it is nonempty and decodes at the intended link layer:

```sh
test -s "$PCAP"
capinfos "$PCAP"
tshark -n -r "$PCAP" -c 10
```

A successful simulation does not prove that the recorder matched a module or observed packets.
